# Inspiration
Looking into the night sky and seeing stars, planets, and meteor showers can often kindle a scientific and imaginative curiosity about our universe. On one hand, you might feel awe about what we collectively know about the universe, thanks to the scientists, engineers, and astronauts who have built upon collective knowledge for hundreds of years. On the other hand, you might feel an otherworldly wonder about the stories you've heard about what causes meteor showers or who lives on the Moon. These perspectives often drive each other. New scientific discoveries create new narratives for films, and fiction provides us with the creativity to solve real problems in new ways.
